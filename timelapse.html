          Sometimes the world moves too fast, and sometimes you can make
          it move even faster in your DSLR film. Time-lapse photography
          allows you to control the universe within your movie by capturing
          a situation in a fraction of the frames, and then playing it
          back at normal speed making it appear as though life is zipping by.
          The main focus here is <i>time</i>. A blooming flower, traffic moving
          on a busy intersection, or people filling a stadium all takes a
          devotion of time to uniquely depict. In the end, putting in the work
          helps you transform minutes, hours, or days into a matter of seconds.

            <h2>First, Have the Right Equipment</h2>
            <p>
              To make it time well spent, you’ll need adequate preparation and the
              right equipment.<br>What you'll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any DSLR camera</li>
              <li>Digital timer/Intervalometer</li>
              <li>Sturdy tripod</li>
              <li>Fresh batteries to last the shoot</li>

            <h2>Determine your subject matter</h2>
            <p>
              You’ll need to figure what you want to capture and how long it will take
              to show the proper activity. For example, a flower blooming can take several
              weeks, whereas people embarking or disembarking public transportation may last
              for only a few minutes.

            <h2>Place Your Camera on the Tripod</h2>
            <p>
              There’s nothing worse than having movement during capture because you didn’t
              tighten the legs or head on your tripod. It also helps if the tripod you're
              using has a hook underneath the mount. This can be used for weighing down your
              tripod to prevent any shake from wind blowing in the area.

            <h2>Set Your Camera to a Narrow Aperture</h2>
            <p>
              With a camera on a tripod and hours of recording ahead of you, you may as well
              use an aperture setting fit to capturing a maximum depth of field. Aperture
              refers to your lens opening size. This is because you want to make sure that you
              get everything in your frame in focus in your timelapse. It is important to remember
              that aperture size is inversely proportional to the f-stop number. So a small aperture
              means a large f-stop number. The smallest aperture will depend on your lens, which
              can range from f/16 to f/22.

            <h2>Shoot in Manual Mode</h2>
            <p>
              If the amount of light in the duration of your shot will stay the same, then manual mode
              is best. However, if you worry light values will shift too much, try the aperture priority
              setting. These work because we’re not using the movie mode. It maintains a consistent
              aperture by adjusting shutter speed when light values change.

            <h2>Pre-timelapse Calculations</h2>
            <p>
              So, before you start making a time-lapse you need to do some calculations. The things needed
              to be calculated are the <b>shooting interval</b>, <b>clip length</b>, <b>event duration</b>, <b>fps
              of finished video</b> and the <b>storage size</b> that the pictures will use.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <b>shooting interval</b> refers to the <b>pause after which a new picture is taken</b>. This can vary from
                situation to situation. For example, if you are shooting moving traffic, fast moving clouds (faster
                than usual) or a time-lapse of your trip to somewhere from inside your car, the interval you would want
                is 1 second. If you are shooting sunsets/sunrises, slow crowds or clouds at normal speed you would want
                an interval of about 1-3 seconds.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>Clip length</b> refers to the <b>length of the final video</b>. This should be a few minutes at most because
                watching a time-lapse longer than that tends to be boring.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>Event duration</b> means how long the <b>event you are time-lapsing is going to last</b>.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>FPS</b> means <b><i>'Frames per Second'</i></b>. This means how many pictures of your time-lapse there will be in
                one second of the finished video. This is usually 24 or 30. If you end up with too many pictures you can always make
                the fps higher to shorten the final video according to your needs. This can be adjusted according to your needs but
                keep in mind that if you go below 24 fps, the final video will be choppy and unpleasant to watch.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>Storage size</b> means the <b>size</b> that <b>all of the photos of the time-lapse</b> will take on the camera. This
                can sometimes be a problem because if you are shooting at a high resolution, the pictures can be of a large size and
                storing these on your mobile or camera can be a problem. If there is not sufficient space to store the images, the time
                for which you will be shooting can be decreased, the megapixel count can be decreased or the shooting interval can be
                increased.

            <h2>Set your Intervalometer</h2>
            <p>
              Once you have calculated the amount of time that you want to capture you entire timelapse and the intervals between each
              shot, connect your intervalometer to your DSLR and set it to the calculated times.

              Now, with everything set and when you see that the time is right, hit the shutter button or the intervalometer button to start
              capturing your timelapse. After your DSLR has finished taking the timelapse, you can use some post-processing software to turn all
              your shots into a video file.
