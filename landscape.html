        <p>
          When photographing landscapes, it can sometimes be difficult to produce a an image that is
          focused in its content, that leads the viewer’s eye exactly where you as the artist want it
          to go. Sometimes, even though you may be presented with a beautiful vista, an image may not
          present itself and you have to work to find it.

            <h2>Find your subject</h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes it’s easy. You choose a building, or a rock formation, or a tree, and it all just comes
              together.  Other times, it becomes more difficult.   Sometimes nothing in particular stands out.
              Look around the scene, find something that draws your eye. Look through your viewfinder, and see how
              things frame up through your camera’s eye.  Once you have found your subject, you have more decisions
              to make.

          <div class="section-text">
            <h2>Where is your subject in the composition?</h2>
            <p>
              This will partly be dictated by its location in relation to you, but also by what else is in your scene.
              Look for interest in relation to what you’ve chosen as the subject. Is there an interesting object or
              pattern in the foreground, which could lead the viewer’s eye to the subject? Is there something in the
              foreground that frames your subject or otherwise adds interest without being distracting?  I will often
              use water or rocks in the foreground if I can.  If it’s water, can you get a reflection of your subject
              in it?  Sometimes it’s leaves, sometimes trees or a fence.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there is nothing in the foreground, try minimizing it by putting the subject as the foreground, and
              looking for background interest.  Interesting clouds or sky, buildings, or trees, can all create a backdrop
              for the landscape. Sometimes, you’re lucky enough to get both an interesting background <b>&</b> foreground. These
              are the times to play with your composition and vary the amounts of foreground and background to see what works
              best, or what doesn’t work at all.   Generally speaking, if the sky is flat and lacks interest, place it
              in the top third of the frame, using the rule of thirds.  If the foreground lacks interest, place that in the
              bottom third.

            <h2>Tie it together</h2>
            <p>
              Once you decide where your subject goes in the frame, what’s in the foreground and what your background will be,
              it’s time to find a way to tie it all together. Are there leading lines that will lead your viewer from foreground
              to background?  Leading lines are an easy way to tie your composition together.  Framing is another way, which I
              included in my discussion of choosing your foreground.  Without tying your composition together, it can often seem
              like you have two separate images in one.  Creating a composition that pulls the viewer through it and leads them
              where you want them to look is the best way to create an effective landscape image.

            <h2>Read the light</h2>
            <p>
              Are you at your location at an optimal time? Some locations are better in the early morning, some in late afternoon.
              Some are good no matter what time you are there. The difference in the light at these times can mean the difference
              between a dramatic landscape image, or a snapshot of a pretty place. There are many iPhone and Android apps that help
              you find out where the sun will be in a given location at a given time. This will enable you to plan when to be a
              location for optimal light.
            </p>
            <p>
              Side lighting will create dramatic shadows and show off textures. Backlighting will help create silhouettes, which can
              be very effective for dramatic images with prominent features breaking the horizon. Front lighting will reveal detail
              everywhere. Often, I will photograph the same location at different times, as different light will create a variety of
              images from the same location.

          <div class="section-text">
            <h2>Choose your shutter speed</h2>
            <p>
              Finally, think about what your shutter speed will do to the image.  If you’re shooting water, shutter speed has a lot to
              do with the water’s appearance in your image. If there are trees, and it’s a breezy day, a faster shutter speed will be
              necessary to freeze the leaves and avoid motion blur. These are things to be aware of when composing your image.
              Learning to visualize these effects in your mind before pressing the shutter button will go a long way toward making you
              a better photographer.
