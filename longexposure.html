        Smooth water, moving clouds, starlit nights, and bustling cityscapes are just some of the unique features that make the magical world of long-exposure photography so
        popular. While achieving these beautiful effects is fairly easy, it does require the use of a few pieces of specialized gear, as well as a few modifications
        to your traditional landscape photography workflow.

            <h2>Check the Weather</h2>
            <p>
             Great weather conditions are imperative to getting a great long exposure photo. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you need a beautiful sunny day with no clouds. In fact,
             clouds and wind are essential elements to capturing a great long exposure photo. While too much wind will work against you, a little bit of wind will add motion
             to the clouds overhead. To monitor the weather, you can use a few specialized websites or smart phone apps.

            <h2>Place the Tripod</h2>
            <p>
              Although wind is essential for the movement of clouds, this does not mean that the wind is our friend entirely. Even a single gust of wind for a few seconds can irreparably
              compromise the quality of an image by shaking the camera. For this reason, take extra care when you are placing your tripod. First of all, if you can, set all three legs of
              the tripod independently to better adapt to the shape of ground. Then, try to make sure that the camera is well balanced with a good center of gravity. If you can, try
              hanging your backpack from the center column to give your camera a bit of extra weight. Also avoid raising the center column of your tripod to prevent camera shake.

            <h2>Compose the Image and Lock the Focus</h2>
            <p>
              Once the tripod is well positioned, you can now refine your composition. The secret to a successful long exposure photograph are the moving elements. So make sure to include
              elements like clouds and rough sea, minimizing the presence and importance of the static objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as you are finished with the composition, maximize your camera’s depth of field, set the focus and then lock it. If you are using your camera’s autofocus, change the
              focus mode to manual as soon as you have achieved a focus lock. This will make sure that you do not lose focus once the filters are mounted.

            <h2>Take a Test Shot</h2>
            <p>
             The test ahot is the reference you will use to calculate the correct exposure time for your long exposure. Before mounting your ND (Neutrual Density) filter, take a photo to achieve the right exposure.
             To determine if the exposure is correct, check the histogram from your test shots and make sure that it isn’t clipping to the left (underexposed image) or to the right (Overexposed). When done, record the
             aperture values, ISO and shutter speed.

          <div class="section-text">
            <h2>Choose and Install the Correct Filters</h2>
            <p>
              It’s finally time to install an ND filter. If you choose to use a filter such as a very dense 10 stop, you will notice that the scene both from the Live View and Viewfinder will be completely dark. Do not
              worry! Even though you can’t see anything through the viewfinder, your camera can.
            </p>
            <p>
              When deciding which filter to use, consider the moving elements of the scene, such as if the clouds are moving slowly or if the sea is rough. To get the classic long exposure effect, a few minutes or more
              of exposure could be needed. In this case, a 10 stop filter might be the right choice. If the sea is very smooth and clouds are moving fast, a 3 stop filter could be a better choice.

            <h2>Set to Bulb Mode</h2>
            <p>
              To exceed the 30″ limit of your camera, set your shutter speed to Bulb mode. Bulb mode will allow you to keep your shutter open for a long as you hold down the button. To do this, it is best to use a shutter
              remote, also known as an intervalometer. That way, you don’t shake the camera while you are pressing the remote button.

            <h2>Take a Photo</h2>
            <p>
              You are finally ready to take the long exposure photo. To decide how long to set the shutter, use the shutter speed of the test shot to calculate how long you will need to keep the mirror locked up. The best way
              to do this is by using a conversion chart.

            <h2>Refine the Shutter Speed According to Histogram</h2>
            <p>
              Once you have taken your photo, it’s time to take a look at the result using your camera’s LCD. While the conversion tables and apps are generally pretty good at predicting how much time you need to leave the shutter
              open for, they aren’t always 100% accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you have taken your photo, take a look at the photo’s histogram to make sure that your photo was exposed properly. To make sure it is correct, you can compare it to your original test photo. If they are about
              the same, then your photo should be perfectly exposed.
