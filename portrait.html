        <p>
          Many people will avoid picking up a camera because they think they don’t have
          an eye for photography. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t take talent to
          capture a solid portrait. It takes skill and the motivation necessary to master
          those skills. Portrait photography can be dealt with as an equation; with just a
          set of rules and guidelines, it’s possible to take stunning portraits with just a
          few steps.

            <h2>Choosing a Composition & Background</h2>
             <p>
              The first thing you need to do when taking a portrait photo is choosing a background.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pick a background that isn’t too distracting
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure your subject stands out from the background
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once you’ve chosen a background, place your subject in your frame using the <b>rule of thirds</b>.
              This is a great place to start, rather than centering your subject directly in the middle of the
              frame, to get something more pleasing to the eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              Try different compositions – wide, close-ups, with negative space, extreme detail shots. Of course,
              you’ll probably want to get a standard medium shot, but get creative with your compositions to have
              more options.

            <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <p>
              Lighting typically scares beginner photographers, but it doesn’t need to. You can take beautiful portraits
              without any artificial lights and flashes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start by picking the right time of day to shoot. 30-60 minutes before sunset is the best time to start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of having your subjects face the sun, put them in between you and the sun. This way, they’ll get a
              nice ‘back light’ that creates a beautiful halo effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are shooting in the middle of the day, put your subject in the shade. Be aware of how bright your
              background is too. Ideally, most of your composition is at a similar exposure. So if your subject is standing
              underneath the shade of a tree, your background should also be a bit shaded to prevent complete overexposure.

            <h2>Exposure</h2>
             <p>
              Understanding the basics of your camera settings to <b>expose properly</b> is the first thing you should do before
              trying to take portraits. Knowing how <b>aperture</b>, <b>shutter speed</b>, and <b>ISO</b> affect your photo and the
              exposure is so important.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically with portraits, the most important part of the image is your subject’s face. And traditionally, the eye is
              drawn to the brightest part of the image. So composing your photo so that the subject’s face is a brighter part of the
              image can help make it pop.
            </p>

            <h2>Depth of Field</h2>
            <p>
              A shallow <b>depth of field</b>, meaning a photo of your subject with a blurry background, is one of the best ways to take your
              mediocre photo to a great photo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting that shallow depth of field isn’t always possible. Newer smartphones like the iPhone X with it’s portrait mode can get this
              shallow depth of field. But most smartphones don’t have the capability yet. This is one case where having a DSLR with an interchangeable
              lens that can open up to a wider aperture will help.
            </p>
            <h3>Ways to Get a Blurry Background</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Decrease your F-stop (i.e. open up your aperture)
              </li>
              <li>
                Step back and zoom in to your subject
              </li>
              <li>
                Move your subject further away from the background
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <img src="images/portraits/DOFportrait.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <img src="images/portraits/portraitcolor.jpg" />
          <div class="section-text">
            <h2>Color</h2>
            <p>
              Pay attention to all of the colors in your composition. In particular see if there are any super bright colors that will distract the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Remember, the viewer’s attention should be on the subject, not the background.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, ask your subject to wear colors that match their style. If you’re really prepared, know ahead of time where you’re going to be shooting
              so that you can ask your subject to wear something that contrasts with the background.
            </p>

            <h2>Interacting & Posing</h2>
            <p>
              Most people will feel a little uncomfortable taking portraits. Do your best to make them feel as comfortable as possible. Have conversations with
              them while you set them up. Tell them jokes. Make them laugh.
            </p>
            <p>
              While you’re shooting, have them take photos while smiling, but also without a huge smile. Sometimes these more serious portraits can look even better.
              If they laugh, keep snapping photos.
